### Graph Summary ([source](https://github.com/pybel/pybel-notebooks/blob/master/summary/Graph%20Summary.ipynb)) ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pybel/pybel-notebooks/blob/master/summary/Graph%20Summary.ipynb))

This notebook demonstrates the ease with which [PyBEL](http://pybel.readthedocs.io) can be used to parse BEL scripts 
and work with other formats for biological knowledge assembly models. It further demonstrates how its sister package,
 [PyBEL Tools](http://pybel-tools.readthedocs.io) can be used to visualize and explore the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
 knowledge assembly model that has been annotated with the 
 [NeuromMMSig Database](http://neurommsig.scai.fraunhofer.de/pathways/introduction) to gain further mechanistic insight.

### Error Analysis ([source](https://github.com/pybel/pybel-notebooks/blob/master/summary/Error%20Analysis.ipynb)) ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pybel/pybel-notebooks/blob/master/summary/Error%20Analysis.ipynb))

This notebook outlines the systematic assessment of errors in a BEL document. The data used is from the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) knowledge assembly model that has been annotated with the [NeuromMMSig Database](http://neurommsig.scai.fraunhofer.de/pathways/introduction). Error analysis is not meant to place blame on contributors to a BEL document, but rather to inform curation leaders where recuration efforts should be focused and to make analysts aware of the issues with a given BEL document.

### Citation Analysis ([source](https://github.com/pybel/pybel-notebooks/blob/master/summary/Citation%20Analysis.ipynb)) ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pybel/pybel-notebooks/blob/master/summary/Citation%20Analysis.ipynb))

This notebook outlines a simple way to explore the citations, authors, and provenance information in a graph and its subgraphs.
