This method can find typos and simple mistakes, but is not as powerful as a text mining approach in identifying logical and domain-specific (biological) mistakes."

    "Many name errors are due to a simple misspelling or capitalization. The Global Match is very good at identifying these errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, there are many identifiers from dbSNP that are simply not included in the namespace. This prompts an update of the namespace for a more modern listing of the names. Other errors have shown that there are terms in the heirarchy of GOBP that are not included in the namespace, and therefore a more general assertion from a publication is difficult to represent in BEL. Interestingly, some of these errors are consistiently used multiple times. This prompts an investigation of the annotation practices used in creating this document. \n",

    "Additionally, this search does not take into account semantics. Proper ontologies could provide much better synonym matching and make better use of modern text-mining techniques. "
