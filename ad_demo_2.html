These often include proteins with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity. Among the best characterized transcriptional co-activator proteins is CREB binding protein (CBP). There is no direct evidence indicating how lower levels of Aï¿½ might initiate CREB phosphorylation principally by Ca2+ signaling and/or through PKA/Atk/ERK pathways. However, exceeding physiological levels of Aï¿½ could deregulate Ca2+ signaling mechanism by excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Since hippocampal neuronal calcium is one of the most potent signals in neuronal gene expression [149], Aï¿½-induced Ca2+ deregulation may lead to compromised synaptic function. Consistence with this hypothesis, AD has been associated with impaired cAMP signaling which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Levels of the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) form of CREB are reduced in AD compared to that of an age-matched healthy control group [164]. Calcium signaling to the cell nucleus is the key inducer of CREB phosphorylation on its activator site serine 133 [165].

Human CHME3 microglia showed intracellular Abeta(1-42) colocalized with lysosome-associated membrane protein-2, indicating phagocytosis. This was increased by interferon-gamma, and to a lesser degree with Protollin, a proteosome-based adjuvant. Secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was decreased by Abeta(1-42) and by interferon-gamma and interleukin-1beta. These cytokines, but not Abeta(1-42), stimulated interleukin-6 release. Microglia which phagocytosed Abeta(1-42) exhibited a higher degree of expression of interleukin-1 receptor type I and inducible nitric oxide synthase. In conclusion, we show that human microglia are able to phagocytose Abeta(1-42) and that this is associated with expression of inflammatory markers.

We detect increased activity of GSK-3ÃŸ after exposure to oligomeric AÃŸ in neurons in culture, in the brain of double transgenic APP/tau mice and in AD brains. Activation of GSK-3ÃŸ, even in the absence of AÃŸ, is sufficient to produce a phenocopy of AÃŸ-induced dendritic spine loss in neurons in culture, while pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3ÃŸ prevents spine loss and increases expression of CREB-target genes like BDNF. Of note, in transgenic mice GSK-3ÃŸ inhibition ameliorated plaque-related neuritic changes and increased CREB-mediated gene expression. Moreover, GSK-3ÃŸ inhibition robustly decreased the oligomeric AÃŸ load in the mouse brain. All these findings support the idea that GSK3ÃŸ is aberrantly activated by the presence of AÃŸ, and contributes, at least in part, to the neuronal anatomical derangement associated with AÃŸ plaques in AD brains and to AÃŸ pathology itself.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neurobiol Dis. 2012 Jan;45(1):425-37.

AMPK activity decreases in AD brain, indicating decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include ÃŸ-amyloid protein (AÃŸ) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate AÃŸ generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating AÃŸ generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of AÃŸ. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including AÃŸ generation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, it is still unclear whether AMPK could serve a potential therapeutic target for AD, and hence, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of AMPK in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neuromolecular Med. 2012 Mar;14(1):1-14.

Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 17; 101(7): 2070Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2075.", "reference": "14970312"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": "Low density lipoprotein subgraph", "BRCO": "Hippocampus"}, "source": 4, "target": 113, "key": 6}, {"relation": "decreases", "evidence": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with accumulations of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and dementia", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Neurosci. 2006 May 10;26(19):5167-79", "reference": "16687508"}, "annotations": {"Disease": "Alzheimer's disease", "Subgraph": "Response to oxidative stress"}, "source": 4, "target": 70, "key": 0}, {"relation": "decreases", "evidence": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with accumulations of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and dementia", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Neurosci. 2006 May 10;26(19):5167-79", "reference": "16687508"}, "annotations": {"Disease": "Alzheimer's disease", "Subgraph": "Amyloidogenic subgraph"}, "source": 4, "target": 70, "key": 1}, {"relation": "decreases", "evidence": "Akt substrates such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448) and decreased levels of cell-cycle inhibitors (p27kip1) are found in AD temporal cortex when compared to controls .

Activation of the neuronal pentameric nAChRs is involved in diverse brain functions including synaptic plasticity and memory [237, 238] and enhances transmitter release in several brain regions including the hippocampus [239], the spinal cord dorsal horn [240], the olfactory bulb, and the amygdala [241]. The increase of synaptic plasticity by AÃƒÅ¸ requires activation of nAChRs [242]. Because activation of nAChRs is necessary for the AÃƒÅ¸-induced increase of synaptic plasticity and memory under normal conditions, AÃƒÅ¸ may modify glutamate release with a mechanism dependent upon activation of nAChRs [83]. However, several reports of the effect of AÃƒÅ¸42 on nAChRs are conflicting. Some studies have reported that AÃƒÅ¸42 activates nAChRs [243, 244], while others indicate that AÃƒÅ¸42 inhibits nAChRs [245, 246]. Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of AÃƒÅ¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of AÃƒÅ¸ produced inhibitory action. The disparity may depend on the nanomolar AÃƒÅ¸1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ42 inhibition of nicotine-induced Ca2+ responses while picomolar AÃƒÅ¸42 directly evokes sustained increases in presynaptic Ca2+ via nAChRs [244]. AÃƒÅ¸42 binds to the nAChR with picomolar affinity [247]. This binding can modulate presynaptic, glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission or glutamate release, suggesting that AÃƒÅ¸42-dependent cholinergic modulation activates signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in synaptic transmission and memory consolidation [248]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the AÃƒÅ¸ peptide with the nAChRs. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that AÃƒÅ¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that AÃƒÅ¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247]. Alternatively, AÃƒÅ¸ might be responsible for regulation of nAChR function through strong binding with membrane lipids [249]. Picomolar or higher AÃƒÅ¸42 acting through nAChRs, can elicit ERK MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures [245, 250] possibly triggered by Ca2+ influx [243, 251]. ERK is known to regulate transcription factors such as CREB and Elk-1 by phosphorylation [140], which help initiate transcription of memory-associated genes that contain their respective regulatory elements [252].

Isomorphic form ApoE4 triggers the production of more Abeta than by ApoE2 or ApoE3; thus, it may play a role in the genetic risk of ApoE4 for the sporadic AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Neurosci. 2007 Apr 11;27(15):4052-60.", "reference": "17428983"}, "subject": {"modifier": "Translocation", "effect": {"fromLoc": {"namespace": "MESHCS", "name": "Cell Surface Extensions"}, "toLoc": {"namespace": "MESHCS", "name": "Endosomes"}}}, "annotations": {"Condition": "Normal Healthy State", "Subgraph": "Endosomal lysosomal subgraph"}, "source": 74, "target": 2, "key": 11}, {"relation": "increases", "evidence": "The level of ÃŸ-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been documented to increase in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, which has resulted in elevation of ÃŸ-amyloid (AÃŸ) peptides.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Eur J Pharmacol. 2012 Jan 30;675(1-3):15-21.

Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-ÃŸ (AÃŸ), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that AÃŸ precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of AÃŸ within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER. This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates AÃŸ within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of AÃŸ in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of AÃŸ in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neurodegener Dis. 2012;10(1-4):60-3.

Thus, the process of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage is a key event and has raised much attention in the field of AD research. It is proposed that APP, beta- and gamma-secretases are all located on the lipid raft, and the meeting of them is an indispensable step for Abeta generation. Endocytosis can lead to clustering of APP, beta- and gamma-secretases from separate smaller lipid rafts into a larger one. On the other hand, for myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or interaction with Ca(2+) can lead to its release from membrane into cytoplasm. This process induces the release of actins and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which are important factors for endocytosis.

Prevalence of AD is reduced among people treated with inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, statins [168, 169] and animal studies support these results [170]. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cholesterol modulates APP processing and affects APP mRNA expression [171]. Another mechanism is the increased binding of AÃƒÅ¸ to ApoE4 over non-E4 alleles. ApoE is a lipid and cholesterol transport protein responsible for the efflux of cholesterol from neurons to form stable complexes both in vitro and in vivo [172]. Allele ApoE4 is a major risk factor in AD [173]. This relationship might promote synaptogenesis, since in vitro studies have demonstrated that cholesterol released by astroglia increases synaptogenesis [174, 175] with resulting modulation of spike rates [176].

The 44 kDa ERK1 and 42 kDa ERK2 are members of the MAPK superfamily that specifically respond to AÃƒÅ¸ in brain cells [127]. ERK1 and ERK2 are known to be activated through dual phosphorylation by the MAPK/ERK on threonine and tyrosine in the Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence of the activation loop [128, 129]. ERK signaling is critical for memory and tightly regulated by many proteins. ERKs are critical for human learning as revealed by human mental retardation syndromes [130]. They are also known to contribute to molecular information processing in dendrites, to stabilize structural changes in dendritic spines and to interact with scaffolding and structural proteins at the synapse [131]. ERK is an important neuronal marker for activity through activation by cytosolic calcium and depolarization of the membrane [132, 133]. On phosphorylation and activation, ERKs phosphorylate other cytoplasmic effectors and are translocated into the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors such as Myc, Fos, Jun, and Elk1 [104, 134]. Direct substrates of the ERKs includetwo members of the RSK family of protein serine-threonine kinases, RSK1 and RSK2. The transcription factor CREB is phosphorylated on serine 133 in vivo by RSK2 in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells [135]. The dependence of CREB phosphorylation on activation of the ERK pathway is suggested by inhibition of AÃƒÅ¸-induced phosphorylation of CREB by piceatannol and the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Other kinases, such as protein kinase A (PKA) or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases [CAM kinases; 136] may also contribute to phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) in response to AÃƒÅ¸ but the complete inhibition of CREB phosphorylation by PD98059 suggests that the ERK pathway is the main signaling pathway elicited by AÃƒÅ¸ leading to transcriptional activation through CREB [137]. These data provide a mechanism by which AÃƒÅ¸ alters gene expression through the transcription factor CREB [137], possibly resulting in a ceiling of activation that limits further formation of new memories.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Alzheimers Dis. 2010;22(3):741-63", "reference": "20847424"}, "subject": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": "MAPK-ERK subgraph"}, "source": 516, "target": 29, "key": 0}, {"relation": "increases", "evidence": "Some cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, donepezil, galantamine) are metabolized via CYP-related enzymes, especially CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Curr Alzheimer Res. 2007 Sep;4(4):479-500", "reference": "17908053"}, "object": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": "Cholesterol metabolism subgraph"}, "source": 517, "target": 45, "key": 0}, {"relation": "decreases", "evidence": "Of the signaling molecules downstream of VEGF receptors, PKC has been demonstrated to be critical in mediating endothelial cell proliferation.17 18 19 Although inhibition of PKC may seem a reasonable approach to curtail endothelial cell proliferation in proliferative retinopathies,20 21 PKC serves diverse essential normal roles in intracellular signaling, indicating broad-spectrum inhibition of all PKCs may have harmful side effects, including cell apoptosis.
